// DEPTH SYSTEM FROM FriendlyCosmonaut's Depth System Tutorial: GMS2

// CURRENTLY DEPRECATED IN THIS PROJECT until the built in depth variable starts being weird

// create a data structure grid with a width (columns) of 2, essentially a 2d array
// Column 1: Stores instance ID of object
// Column 2: Stores current y position of said object
ds_depthgrid = ds_grid_create(2, 1);
